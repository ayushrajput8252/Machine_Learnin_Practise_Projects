Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals.\\n\\nAnd some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice.\\n\\nFormer Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to \\\"be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club,\\\" told CNN that Walmart's actions \\\"foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Republican Party will have to better stand for\\\" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be \\\"willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians.\\\"\\n\\nWalmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed.\\n\\nWalmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support.\\n\\nIt has been a gradual transformation for Walmart.\\n\\n\\\"It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position,\\\" said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. \\\"But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different.\\\"\\n\\nHill added: Same-sex marriage, \\\"while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer.\\\"\\n\\nThe backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality.\\n\\nAfter Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state.\\n\\nThe resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act.\\n\\nNASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law.\\n\\n\\\"What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business,\\\" said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign.\\n\\nNational Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination.\\n\\n\\\"By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place,\\\" Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash.\\n\\nOthers in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law.\\n\\nMeanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would \\\"permit unfair discrimination\\\" against the LGBT community.\\n\\nJay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies.\\n\\n\\\"When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,\\\" Chesshir said. \\\"Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly.\\\"\",\n          \"State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that an unknown U.S. official made a request over the phone to delete several minutes of a December 2013 video of the exchange between reporters and a State Department spokeswoman. The State Department routinely posts on its site the briefing that it holds nearly every day with the diplomatic press corps.\\n\\nKirby said the department technician who made the edit could not recall who requested it.\\n\\nThe deleted portion of the video involves questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal were taking place.\\n\\nAfter it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the U.S. and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations.\\n\\nEarlier this month Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes acknowledged to The New York Times that the administration was deceptive about the talks, creating a \\\"narrative\\\" that they did not take place. When James Rosen of Fox News -- who asked the original questions of Psaki -- tried to refer back to the video last month, he found the exchange had been deleted. Kirby, who originally called the deletion a \\\"glitch,\\\" said Wednesday that he asked State Department lawyers to look into the matter after being notified about the omission. \\\"They learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,\\\" Kirby said. Another senior State Department official said the technician found the request \\\"unusual\\\" and consulted her supervisor before making the edit. The supervisor, who also could not remember the name of the person who called, approved the request because it came from someone \\\"from a certain level and credibility\\\" in the Department of Public Affairs. \\\"Although this person did not remember the person who called her, or the person they were calling on behalf of, she remembers it was not (Jen) Psaki,\\\" this official said. \\\"Jen did not request it, did not know about it and had nothing to do with it.\\\" Psaki, who now is the White House communications director, tweeted Wednesday that she was unaware of the episode: \\\"I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @StateDept.\\\" Kirby noted that the full briefing transcript, including the exchange on Iran, had always been available on the State Department website and that the omitted video has since been replaced with a complete version that had been archived with the Defense Department. He said that was the only instance he was aware of in which briefing videos were edited, though he couldn't be sure there weren't others. He announced a new policy Wednesday in which every video would be posted immediately with all edits disclosed. \\\"To my surprise, the Bureau of Public Affairs did not have in place any rules governing this type of action,\\\" he said. \\\"Therefore, we are taking immediate steps to craft appropriate protocols on this issue, as we believe that deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability.\\\" Because such rules weren't previously in place, Kirby said he found \\\"no reason\\\" to press forward with a more formal investigation.\",\n          \"Leave a reply \\nBill Still \\u2013 Good evening, I\\u2019m still reporting on an ongoing counter-coup being run by patriotic members of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies to stop the Clinton Crime syndicate from proceeding with the rigging of the coming election. \\nAccording to a 4 minute video, done by Dr. Steve Pieczenik, a Harvard and MIT-educated psychiatrist who has written 26 New York Times Best Sellers, the Clinton coup has been put down by an intelligence community counter-coup, effective at noon today. \\nDr. Pieczenik has great contacts in the American intelligence community. He put the following video up on his YouTube channel at noon today and says that the channel was down twenty minutes later. \\nCurrently, that channel is up, so perhaps our channel will not be harmed. \\nI believe what you are about to see is true because of the nature of the recent WikiLeaks revelations. To me, hackers could not have done this. To me, white hats at NSA had to have been involved. \\nHaving spent my adult life working around the community, I knew that folks who were at most of these agencies \\u2013 exempting DHS and CIA \\u2013 are American patriots who would not allow this nation to be destroyed by the Clinton Crime Syndicate. \\n[insert] \\nThis may well be the reason President Obama yesterday had his press secretary praise the work of Jim Comey, head of the FBI, at the very moment that Hillary Clinton was speaking in Florida deriding Comey. Let us all pray that Comey has actually turned away from being subservient to Obama and the Clintons and has now joined forces with the vast majority of the American military/intelligence community and Obama has decided \\u2013 for his own preservation \\u2013 to not fight them.

Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals.\\n\\nAnd some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice.\\n\\nFormer Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to \\\"be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club,\\\" told CNN that Walmart's actions \\\"foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Republican Party will have to better stand for\\\" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be \\\"willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians.\\\"\\n\\nWalmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed.\\n\\nWalmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support.\\n\\nIt has been a gradual transformation for Walmart.\\n\\n\\\"It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position,\\\" said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. \\\"But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different.\\\"\\n\\nHill added: Same-sex marriage, \\\"while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer.\\\"\\n\\nThe backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality.\\n\\nAfter Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state.\\n\\nThe resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act.\\n\\nNASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law.\\n\\n\\\"What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business,\\\" said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign.\\n\\nNational Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination.\\n\\n\\\"By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place,\\\" Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash.\\n\\nOthers in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law.\\n\\nMeanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would \\\"permit unfair discrimination\\\" against the LGBT community.\\n\\nJay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies.\\n\\n\\\"When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,\\\" Chesshir said. \\\"Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly.\\\"\",\n          \"State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that an unknown U.S. official made a request over the phone to delete several minutes of a December 2013 video of the exchange between reporters and a State Department spokeswoman. The State Department routinely posts on its site the briefing that it holds nearly every day with the diplomatic press corps.\\n\\nKirby said the department technician who made the edit could not recall who requested it.\\n\\nThe deleted portion of the video involves questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal were taking place.\\n\\nAfter it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the U.S. and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations.\\n\\nEarlier this month Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes acknowledged to The New York Times that the administration was deceptive about the talks, creating a \\\"narrative\\\" that they did not take place. When James Rosen of Fox News -- who asked the original questions of Psaki -- tried to refer back to the video last month, he found the exchange had been deleted. Kirby, who originally called the deletion a \\\"glitch,\\\" said Wednesday that he asked State Department lawyers to look into the matter after being notified about the omission. \\\"They learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,\\\" Kirby said. Another senior State Department official said the technician found the request \\\"unusual\\\" and consulted her supervisor before making the edit. The supervisor, who also could not remember the name of the person who called, approved the request because it came from someone \\\"from a certain level and credibility\\\" in the Department of Public Affairs. \\\"Although this person did not remember the person who called her, or the person they were calling on behalf of, she remembers it was not (Jen) Psaki,\\\" this official said. \\\"Jen did not request it, did not know about it and had nothing to do with it.\\\" Psaki, who now is the White House communications director, tweeted Wednesday that she was unaware of the episode: \\\"I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @StateDept.\\\" Kirby noted that the full briefing transcript, including the exchange on Iran, had always been available on the State Department website and that the omitted video has since been replaced with a complete version that had been archived with the Defense Department. He said that was the only instance he was aware of in which briefing videos were edited, though he couldn't be sure there weren't others. He announced a new policy Wednesday in which every video would be posted immediately with all edits disclosed. \\\"To my surprise, the Bureau of Public Affairs did not have in place any rules governing this type of action,\\\" he said. \\\"Therefore, we are taking immediate steps to craft appropriate protocols on this issue, as we believe that deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability.\\\" Because such rules weren't previously in place, Kirby said he found \\\"no reason\\\" to press forward with a more formal investigation.\",\n          \"Leave a reply \\nBill Still \\u2013 Good evening, I\\u2019m still reporting on an ongoing counter-coup being run by patriotic members of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies to stop the Clinton Crime syndicate from proceeding with the rigging of the coming election. \\nAccording to a 4 minute video, done by Dr. Steve Pieczenik, a Harvard and MIT-educated psychiatrist who has written 26 New York Times Best Sellers, the Clinton coup has been put down by an intelligence community counter-coup, effective at noon today. \\nDr. Pieczenik has great contacts in the American intelligence community. He put the following video up on his YouTube channel at noon today and says that the channel was down twenty minutes later. \\nCurrently, that channel is up, so perhaps our channel will not be harmed. \\nI believe what you are about to see is true because of the nature of the recent WikiLeaks revelations.

Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals.\\n\\nAnd some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice.\\n\\nFormer Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to \\\"be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club,\\\" told CNN that Walmart's actions \\\"foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Republican Party will have to better stand for\\\" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be \\\"willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians.\\\"\\n\\nWalmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed.\\n\\nWalmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support.\\n\\nIt has been a gradual transformation for Walmart.\\n\\n\\\"It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position,\\\" said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. \\\"But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different.\\\"\\n\\nHill added: Same-sex marriage, \\\"while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer.\\\"\\n\\nThe backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality.\\n\\nAfter Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state.\\n\\nThe resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act.\\n\\nNASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law.\\n\\n\\\"What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business,\\\" said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign.\\n\\nNational Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination.\\n\\n\\\"By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place,\\\" Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash.\\n\\nOthers in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law.\\n\\nMeanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would \\\"permit unfair discrimination\\\" against the LGBT community.\\n\\nJay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies.\\n\\n\\\"When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,\\\" Chesshir said. \\\"Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly.\\\"\",\n          \"State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that an unknown U.S. official made a request over the phone to delete several minutes of a December 2013 video of the exchange between reporters and a State Department spokeswoman. The State Department routinely posts on its site the briefing that it holds nearly every day with the diplomatic press corps.\\n\\nKirby said the department technician who made the edit could not recall who requested it.\\n\\nThe deleted portion of the video involves questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal were taking place.\\n\\nAfter it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the U.S. and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations.\\n\\nEarlier this month Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes acknowledged to The New York Times that the administration was deceptive about the talks, creating a \\\"narrative\\\" that they did not take place. When James Rosen of Fox News -- who asked the original questions of Psaki -- tried to refer back to the video last month, he found the exchange had been deleted. Kirby, who originally called the deletion a \\\"glitch,\\\" said Wednesday that he asked State Department lawyers to look into the matter after being notified about the omission. \\\"They learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,\\\" Kirby said. Another senior State Department official said the technician found the request \\\"unusual\\\" and consulted her supervisor before making the edit. The supervisor, who also could not remember the name of the person who called, approved the request because it came from someone \\\"from a certain level and credibility\\\" in the Department of Public Affairs. \\\"Although this person did not remember the person who called her, or the person they were calling on behalf of, she remembers it was not (Jen) Psaki,\\\" this official said. \\\"Jen did not request it, did not know about it and had nothing to do with it.\\\" Psaki, who now is the White House communications director, tweeted Wednesday that she was unaware of the episode: \\\"I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @StateDept.\\\" Kirby noted that the full briefing transcript, including the exchange on Iran, had always been available on the State Department website and that the omitted video has since been replaced with a complete version that had been archived with the Defense Department. He said that was the only instance he was aware of in which briefing videos were edited, though he couldn't be sure there weren't others. He announced a new policy Wednesday in which every video would be posted immediately with all edits disclosed. \\\"To my surprise, the Bureau of Public Affairs did not have in place any rules governing this type of action,\\\" he said. \\\"Therefore, we are taking immediate steps to craft appropriate protocols on this issue, as we believe that deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability.\\\" Because such rules weren't previously in place, Kirby said he found \\\"no reason\\\" to press forward with a more formal investigation.\",\n          \"Leave a reply \\nBill Still \\u2013 Good evening, I\\u2019m still reporting on an ongoing counter-coup being run by patriotic members of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies to stop the Clinton Crime syndicate from proceeding with the rigging of the coming election. \\nAccording to a 4 minute video, done by Dr. Steve Pieczenik, a Harvard and MIT-educated psychiatrist who has written 26 New York Times Best Sellers, the Clinton coup has been put down by an intelligence community counter-coup, effective at noon today. \\nDr. Pieczenik has great contacts in the American intelligence community.

Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals.\\n\\nAnd some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice.\\n\\nFormer Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to \\\"be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club,\\\" told CNN that Walmart's actions \\\"foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Republican Party will have to better stand for\\\" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be \\\"willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians.\\\"\\n\\nWalmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed.\\n\\nWalmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support.\\n\\nIt has been a gradual transformation for Walmart.\\n\\n\\\"It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position,\\\" said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. \\\"But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different.\\\"\\n\\nHill added: Same-sex marriage, \\\"while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer.\\\"\\n\\nThe backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality.\\n\\nAfter Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state.\\n\\nThe resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act.\\n\\nNASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law.\\n\\n\\\"What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business,\\\" said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign.\\n\\nNational Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination.\\n\\n\\\"By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place,\\\" Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash.\\n\\nOthers in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law.\\n\\nMeanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would \\\"permit unfair discrimination\\\" against the LGBT community.\\n\\nJay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies.\\n\\n\\\"When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,\\\" Chesshir said. \\\"Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly.\\\"\",\n          \"State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that an unknown U.S. official made a request over the phone to delete several minutes of a December 2013 video of the exchange between reporters and a State Department spokeswoman. The State Department routinely posts on its site the briefing that it holds nearly every day with the diplomatic press corps.\\n\\nKirby said the department technician who made the edit could not recall who requested it.\\n\\nThe deleted portion of the video involves questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal were taking place.\\n\\nAfter it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the U.S. and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations.\\n\\nEarlier this month Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes acknowledged to The New York Times that the administration was deceptive about the talks, creating a \\\"narrative\\\" that they did not take place. When James Rosen of Fox News -- who asked the original questions of Psaki -- tried to refer back to the video last month, he found the exchange had been deleted. Kirby, who originally called the deletion a \\\"glitch,\\\" said Wednesday that he asked State Department lawyers to look into the matter after being notified about the omission. \\\"They learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,\\\" Kirby said. Another senior State Department official said the technician found the request \\\"unusual\\\" and consulted her supervisor before making the edit. The supervisor, who also could not remember the name of the person who called, approved the request because it came from someone \\\"from a certain level and credibility\\\" in the Department of Public Affairs. \\\"Although this person did not remember the person who called her, or the person they were calling on behalf of, she remembers it was not (Jen) Psaki,\\\" this official said. \\\"Jen did not request it, did not know about it and had nothing to do with it.\\\" Psaki, who now is the White House communications director, tweeted Wednesday that she was unaware of the episode: \\\"I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @StateDept.\\\" Kirby noted that the full briefing transcript, including the exchange on Iran, had always been available on the State Department website and that the omitted video has since been replaced with a complete version that had been archived with the Defense Department. He said that was the only instance he was aware of in which briefing videos were edited, though he couldn't be sure there weren't others. He announced a new policy Wednesday in which every video would be posted immediately with all edits disclosed. \\\"To my surprise, the Bureau of Public Affairs did not have in place any rules governing this type of action,\\\" he said. \\\"Therefore, we are taking immediate steps to craft appropriate protocols on this issue, as we believe that deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability.\\\" Because such rules weren't previously in place, Kirby said he found \\\"no reason\\\" to press forward with a more formal investigation.\",\n          \"Leave a reply \\nBill Still \\u2013 Good evening, I\\u2019m still reporting on an ongoing counter-coup being run by patriotic members of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies to stop the Clinton Crime syndicate from proceeding with the rigging of the coming election. \\nAccording to a 4 minute video, done by Dr. Steve Pieczenik, a Harvard and MIT-educated psychiatrist who has written 26 New York Times Best Sellers, the Clinton coup has been put down by an intelligence community counter-coup, effective at noon today. \\nDr. Pieczenik has great contacts in the American intelligence community. He put the following video up on his YouTube channel at noon today and says that the channel was down twenty minutes later. \\nCurrently, that channel is up, so perhaps our channel will not be harmed. \\nI believe what you are about to see is true because of the nature of the recent WikiLeaks revelations. To me, hackers could not have done this. To me, white hats at NSA had to have been involved. \\nHaving spent my adult life working around the community, I knew that folks who were at most of these agencies \\u2013 exempting DHS and CIA \\u2013 are American patriots who would not allow this nation to be destroyed by the Clinton Crime Syndicate. \\n[insert] \\nThis may well be the reason President Obama yesterday had his press secretary praise the work of Jim Comey, head of the FBI, at the very moment that Hillary Clinton was speaking in Florida deriding Comey. Let us all pray that Comey has actually turned away from being subservient to Obama and the Clintons and has now joined forces with the vast majority of the American military/intelligence community and Obama has decided \\u2013 for his own preservation \\u2013 to not fight them. I\\u2019m still reporting from Washington; good evening. \\nBill Still is a former newspaper editor and publisher.
